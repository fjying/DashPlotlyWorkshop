## Dash Plotly Workshop #
This workshop gives the introduction to create the interactive plots along with dashboards
using Plotly and Dash in Python. Without the need to delve into more complex programming languages like JavaScript and HTML, you would just learn a few straightforward functions to generate plots and even dashboard to visualize the reserach data in interactive ways! The interactive data visualization enables us to integrate the complex information into the vivid plots to boost the research analysis.
